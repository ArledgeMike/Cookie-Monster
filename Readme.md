<p>After a second I realized that this couldn't be the first time this name was used. So there is another cookie monster. Go <a href="https://github.com/jgallen23/cookie-monster">look at his code</a> it is better. Also I researched this <a href="https://github.com/ScottHamper/Cookies">other library by this fella</a> as well. All were very helpful. Thank you and I will be changing the name of this repo in the near future.</p>
